# Post Feed App: Project Review
A social media app of users creating posts and others commenting on them.
* Setup the database using MongoDB and Apollo
* Created the backend server using Node.js and Express
* Created the front-end using React FramWork
* Setup the routes of the app using React Routes
* Stylde the App using Semantic UI
* Connected the front-end to the database using Apollo Client

## Packages:
### Backend
* **Apollo-Server:** To initiate the server to run the database
* **Mongoose:** To access the Mongo Atlas database
* **jsonwebtoken:** To get a token encoding the user's data
* **bcryptjs:** To encrypt user's password
### Frontend
* **@Apollo-client:** To access the apollo-server database
* **Semantic-ui:** To style the webpages
* **React-router:** To access different routes and render components at each route
* **moment:** Get the time passed in a beautiful shape

## Start Editing?
run ```npm intall``` on the server and client's codes to install dependencies
## Deployment
* For the backend: I used heroku to deploy the database
* For the frontend: I used Netlify to deploy the build from the client app
